option.help-description=Show help message on how to use the login command.
detailed-help=Performs a log in to the configured Carbyne Stack virtual cloud providers using OAuth2. \n \
\n \
OAuth2 parameters (client identifier and callback URL) can be specified using the Carbyne Stack CLI configuration command. \n \
\n \
The command will only work on systems where a browser is available that can be used to acquire user consent. \n \
If this is not the case in your setting (e.g. your system is headless), you can perform the login using the same \n \
configuration on an auxiliary machine and then copy the generated configuration from the auxiliary to the original machine. \n \
\n \
The tokens are written to '~/.cs/access-tokens.json'.
